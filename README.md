# siege-mode
An emacs minor mode to surround the region with smart delimiters interactively.

## Lay siege to the region from all sides!
### (with the power of regular expressions)

When the region is active, all input is redirected to the minibuffer and treated
as a delimiter for the region. The input is used as the left delimiter from
which the right one is derived using `siege-transform-regexs` applied to tokens
generated by `siege-boundary-list` and `siege-block-*`. If such derivations are
not desired they may be disabled via "C-c a" in the minibuffer or by default
(`siege-default-derive`).

All changes are dynamically displayed in the buffer (see `siege-preview-face`)
and may be committed by "SPC" or "Ret" in the minibuffer.

By default siege-mode understands the usual delimeter pairs, as well as latex
LaTeX begin/end pairs and left/right pairs. Moreover, for ease of use it will
pair both `_{` and `^{` with `}` by default.
